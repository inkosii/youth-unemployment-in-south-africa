# ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦ Youth Unemployment Analysis in South Africa (Ages 15â€“24)

This project explores and analyzes youth unemployment trends in South Africa using a dataset derived from ILOSTAT's SDG indicator 8.5.2 â€” **Unemployment Rate (%) by Age, Sex, and Country**.

## Tools Used
- **Python (Google Colab)** for data cleaning, encoding, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** for visual analytics
- **Power BI** for interactive storytelling and dashboards
- **GitHub** for project version control and documentation

## Goal
To understand the patterns, gender disparities, and time-based changes in unemployment among South African youth (ages 15â€“24), and present the insights using visual and statistical techniques.


## âœ… Summary of Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Filtered only South African data  
   - Focused on youth age group (15â€“24)  
   - Removed unnecessary columns with excessive null values  
   - Encoded categorical features for further analysis

2. **Data Exploration**  
   - Correlation analysis  
   - Time-series analysis by gender  
   - Detected notable spikes (for example post-2020 due to COVID-19)

3. **Visualization**  
   - Line plots show trends over time for Male, Female, and Total  
   - Highest unemployment consistently observed among young females

4. **Power BI Storytelling (Coming Next)**  
   - Visual dashboards with filters (gender, year)  
   - Key insights for policymaking and socio-economic review

## Key Insights
- Youth unemployment has fluctuated between **42% to 70%** over the past two decades.
- **Females** consistently face higher unemployment rates than males.
- Sharp increase post-2020 indicates COVID-19â€™s economic impact on youth employment.

## Future Plans
- Add forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Facebook Prophet)
- Compare trends across other Southern African countries
- Integrate education/training level to explore deeper insights
